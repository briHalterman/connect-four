# Connect Four CLI Game

A command-line version of the classic **Connect Four** game, built in Ruby with a focus on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

Players take turns dropping tokens into a 7-column, 6-row grid. The first to connect four of their tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins!
